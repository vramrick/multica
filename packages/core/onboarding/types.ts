 * Every question is single-select with an explicit `"other"` escape
 * hatch that expands a free-text input (capped at 80 chars). When a
 * user picks a concrete option, the matching `*_other` field stays
 * null; when they pick `"other"`, the `*_other` field is required and
 * stores the user's custom answer.
 *
 * `use_case_other` is special — it gets embedded directly into the
 * Step 5 first-issue prompt, so Other users receive *more* personalized
 * content, not a generic fallback. `team_size_other` / `role_other`
 * are captured for market research only and don't drive any automated
 * routing.
